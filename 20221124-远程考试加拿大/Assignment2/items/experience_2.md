#### Learn guitar
I learned guitar in junior high school.
The most painful thing about learning guitar is that my fingers are not flexible enough and the practice is very slow. At one point I wanted to give up.
But when I successfully played a complete piece for the first time, I was very happy.
The process of learning guitar has taught me to persevere and not give up halfway.
I give this experience C.
