#### Draw
I have been learning to draw since elementary school.
My body and mind feel very relaxed when I paint.
The happiest thing is to take part in the competition for the first time with my own works and achieve good results.
But sometimes I don't have inspiration and feel very uncomfortable.
I think I can give this experience an A.
