#### Part-time
When I first started college, I used to do some part-time jobs to earn living expenses, such as handing out flyers and playing dolls. This experience made me realize how difficult life is.
The first time I got my paycheck, I almost jumped for joy.
Every time I finish my part-time job and go back to the dorm, I feel exhausted.
I think I can give this experience C.
